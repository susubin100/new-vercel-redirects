## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) which is bundled with
[node](https://nodejs.org/en/). It can be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies` and
used via an npm script.

```sh
npm install --save-dev vercel-redirects
```

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "shorten": "vercel-redirects"
  }
}
```

You can then then run `npm run shorten <destination-url>`.

You can also install and run this globally.

```sh
npm install -g vercel-redirects
```

Or run it through `npx`.

```sh
npx vercel-redirects https://url.to.redirect.to.com
```

## Usage

Use the cli directly from your command line or as an npm script.

Add a new redirect. Short url is created for you if you dont provide a source.

```sh
vercel-redirects add /destination-url /source-url
vercel-redirects /destination-url /source-url
vercel-redirects -c 302 /destination-url /source-url
vercel-redirects --status-code 302 /destination-url /source-url

```sh
vercel-redirects add /destination-url
vercel-redirects /destination-url
vercel-redirects https://codfish.io
vercel-redirects -c 302 https://codfish.io
vercel-redirects --status-code 302 https://codfish.io
```

## Configuration

Add configuration in the following ways (in order of precedence):

1. A `vercel-redirects` object in your `package.json`.
1. A `.vercelredirectsrc.json` file to the root of your project.
1. A `.vercelredirectsrc` file to the root of your project.

**package.json example:**

```json
{
  "vercel-redirects": {
    "autoPush": true
  }
}
```

**.vercelredirectsrc.json and .vercelredirectsrc example:**

```json
{
  "autoPush": true
}
```

| ---------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `autoPush` | boolean | `false` | Automatically commit and push, effectively deploying whenever changes are made. |

## Inspiration

I had originally created a URL shortener, `codfi.sh`, for a project I built as a part
of a General Assembly course. For a number of reasons, this project was kind of a pain to
maintain for me over the years.

I stumbled upon Kent C. Dodd's
[netlify-shortner](https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener) & his url shortener
[app tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL6paXyx6hM), and was motivated to create my own and
migrate my short url domain, `codfi.sh` to use that instead.

However, I'm a huge fan of Vercel (formally Now) and that's what I personally use for all my
serverless apps. This cli utility was built to help facilitate the creation of redirects & short
urls for Vercel projects, very much in the same vein as `netlify-shortener`.
